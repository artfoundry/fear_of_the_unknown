    "instructions"  : "You must kill every last frightful being to survive and leave with your life and your sanity. Each time you get near a creature, you lose a bit of your sanity, and each time you're attacked, you lose some health.  If you are attacked three times, you will die.  If you lose your sanity, you will die (essentially, as you will become a gibbering mess and easy prey).\n\nTo move, either click any space directly around your character or use the numeric keypad.  Clicking on a monster or moving toward a monster next to you with the keyboard will attack the monster. Good luck!\n\n",

    "tips"          : "There are two types of monsters: an Elder, and the Shoggoths. The Elder creates a Shoggoth every turn and must be attacked three times to kill it.  While the Elder cannot attack, the Shoggoths can.  Each Shoggoth will attack if you approach within one square of it, but can be killed with one hit.  Every turn you are next to any monster, you will lose some sanity for each monster you're next to.\n\nThere are three levels in the dungeon.  Be sure to explore all of them!\n\nYour final score is calculated from the amount of remaining health, remaining sanity, number of monsters you kill, whether you find the Elder Sign, whether you kill the Elder, and whether you win the game (killing all monsters in the dungeon).",
